        This website has been developed as part of our college major project by a team of four passionate students.
        Our aim was to create a functional, user-friendly, and visually engaging platform while applying the skills and technologies we've learned throughout our academic journey.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        From backend development and database integration to frontend design and user experience, we have worked collaboratively to ensure this project showcases our abilities and teamwork.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        We hope this project not only meets the requirements of our curriculum but also serves as a solid foundation for future development and learning.
